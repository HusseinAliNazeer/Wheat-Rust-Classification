 Future guide 
    • Consider disease resistance levels when selecting varieties
    • Plant at the recommended date for your area 
    • Plant several varieties that differ in their genetics 
    • Plant into a well-prepared seedbed
$
 Leaf rust management 
    • Do not spray for leaf rust in the fall.
    •  never wait until disease is observed on the flag leaf, if the disease is detected.  
    • Sow resistant varieties 
    • Some seed treatments control leaf rust for 8–12 weeks
    •  Foliar sprays may suppress the disease in infected crops for three to five weeks
$
Stem rust management 
    • monitor susceptible crops at 7-14-day intervals from flag leaf to early dough grain development.
    • Sow resistant varieties 
    • Control summer/autumn volunteers through tillage 
    • grazing or spraying herbicides 
    • Foliar fungicide sprays can be used if applied early  
$
 Cultural practice 
    • Use certified, fungicide-treated seed.
    • Control volunteer wheat and grassy weeds before planting.
